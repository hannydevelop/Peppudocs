# Introduction

At Peppubooks, we're building an all-in-one solution for all your accounting needs using Google cloud services. We're building streamlined accounting tools, from startups, freelancers, small and medium sized businesses to large 
companies.

At Peppubooks, we are committed to providing the platform that eases your accounting needs through automation and organization of accounting processes using Googlesheets. All processes from payment scheduling, accounting payables, invoice receipts and quotes generation as well as accounting reports can be generated with a few clicks. We don't store user's sensitive information and every data created by the user is stored in their Google Drive.

# Motivation

Most of us have worked with quite a few accounting software over the years. While they all are pretty solid solutions, each have their own pros and cons that you have to weigh before using them. For instance according to [research](), data shows that between 750 million and a billion people use Excel or other spreadsheet tools globally.  

We think that basing Peppubooks on this research and modern accounting principles, we're an accounting solution that's very performant. These principles are as follows:

1. Cloud Computing.

    Modern accounting like Peppubooks utilizes cloud computing in which information is stored in a centralized database (Google Drive) that can be accessed over the Internet (the cloud) from anywhere. This means that our users can easily pickup from where they stopped or start their accounting on the go.

2. Real-Time Integration.

    In traditional accounting, users need to manually enter accounting information. However, Peppubooks can eliminate the need for manual entry of this information through digital applications which capture the data from these different source materials and inputting it into a central information source. All this, while being able to dramatically speed up the time it takes to enter and process information.

3. Automatic Transaction Completion.

    In traditional accounting, when sales transactions like invoicing complete, the user needs to complete the transaction manually. However, with Peppubooks structure, invoicing actions can complete automatically once they are paid.

4. Collaboration

    Collaboration is a very important feature that modern accounting platforms provide. Howbiet how important this feature is, traditional accounting platforms haven't perfected this feature. With Peppubooks, our users can enjoy Google's collaboration and safety feature on Google Sheet while working on their transaction template.
